# Pointer Problems in C++

This repository contains solutions to six programming problems related to pointers in C++. The problems are part of a lab for an Object Oriented Programming course offered at Fast Nuces Lahore.

## Problem 1: [Monkey Food Intake](https://github.com/hasnayahya101/OOP_Lab_1_Fast_Nuces_2023/blob/main/l227971_q1_oop.cpp)

The first problem asks to write a program that stores information about food intake of three monkeys in a two-dimensional 3x5 array and create a report of average food intake per day, the least and greatest food intake during the week by any one monkey. The program should validate input and not accept negative numbers for pounds of food eaten.

## Problem 2: [Pointers](https://github.com/hasnayahya101/OOP_Lab_1_Fast_Nuces_2023/blob/main/l227971_q2_oop.cpp)

The second problem requires the observation of output for a given code that demonstrates the use of pointers.

## Problem 3: [Sum, Difference, Product, Square of Integers](https://github.com/hasnayahya101/OOP_Lab_1_Fast_Nuces_2023/blob/main/l227971_q3_oop.cpp)

The third problem asks to write a program that takes input two integers and finds their sum, difference, product, and square using pointers.

## Problem 4: [Area of Rectangle](https://github.com/hasnayahya101/OOP_Lab_1_Fast_Nuces_2023/blob/main/l227971_q4_oop.cpp)

The fourth problem asks to write a program that takes the height and width of a rectangle as input and computes the area using pointers.

## Problem 5: [Mean of Integers](https://github.com/hasnayahya101/OOP_Lab_1_Fast_Nuces_2023/blob/main/l227971_q5_oop.cpp)

The fifth problem asks to find and print the mean of three integers using pointer variables.

## Problem 6: [Largest and Smallest Number](https://github.com/hasnayahya101/OOP_Lab_1_Fast_Nuces_2023/blob/main/l227971_q6_oop.cpp)

The sixth problem asks to take three numbers from the user, find the largest and smallest number and print the result using pointer variables.
_The code for each of these problems is written in **C++**. Use the code, However you like._
